Electrical and electronic devices contain variable amount of chemical elements which can be hazardous but also valuable. Despite the specific legislations issued to regulate the manufacturer responsibility to close the life-cycle of the products, most of the e-waste still ends up in landfills with a big impact on environment. This problem is even more serious considering also the increasing trend of annual global production of e-waste (see Figure 1). This problem exists mainly because consumers of electric and electronic devices have no incentives to return the products after utilization.
